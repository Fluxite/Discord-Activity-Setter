# Discord Activity Setter
A script designed to update Discord's activity tab with Chrome's current URL.

# Things To Do  
- Update script to inject into Discord (potential API/file edit?)  
- Provide credits  
- Modernise the repository  
- Maybe make compatible with external providers  
- Anything else which comes up
- Set it to update on a loop (potential rerun script/put into endless loop, if check we'll see)
- Build an EXE.
